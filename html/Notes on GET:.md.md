Notes on GET:
• Appends the form data to the URL, in name/value pairs
• NEVER use GET to send sensitive data! (the submitted form data is visible in the URL!)
• The length of a URL is limited (2048 characters)
• Useful for form submissions where a user wants to bookmark the result
• GET is good for non-secure data, like query strings in Google
Notes on POST:
• Appends the form data inside the body of the HTTP request (the submitted form data is not shown in the URL)
• POST has no size limitations, and can be used to send large amounts of data.
• Form submissions with POST cannot be bookmarked
Tip: Always use POST if the form data contains sensitive or personal information!
